    <h3>About this project</h3>
    <p>I designed this project to use design approaches learned in my HCI class. I put special thought into the time element. Page load and update times were a very important aspect in this project.</p>
    <p>I also did not want a confusing menu structure so I made it so that the entire site (except this page) is usable from the dashboard.</p>
    <p>Originally the site was going to be a mobile app and to that end I put special consideration towards mobile use. If the site crosses below a threshold it will break into 1 column. Also the nav bar is at the bottom right for ease of access when using thumbs.</p>
